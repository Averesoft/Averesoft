### Hey! 

I'm Jeremy, and I go to William Lyon Mackenzie C.I., or Wlmac, for the MaCS program, a specialized math and science enriched program! 

I was first exposed to competitive programming in 2019 when I was self-learning Java, but only started seriously grinding during the quarantine. Now, I've been converted to a C++ main and practice on DMOJ. 

In my spare time, I like to play video games, watch anime, and listen to the Official Podcast.
